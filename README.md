# SoundByte Music Providers

This repository contains the official SoundByte Music Providers. These music providers are all in various stages of development.

The `soundbyte.d.ts` file is the JavaScript API def, (note that some features may be added via the manifest file).

## How to build

These extensions do not use TypeScript, but instead make use of the TypeScript CLI to combine files.

1. Ensure node / npm are installed (or see step 2)
2. `npm install -g typescript` (`sudo apt install node-typescript` might also work on linux / WSL)
3. `npm install uglify-js -g`
4. Navigate to the extension folder that you wish to build / run
5. Run the `build.sh` command to generate the extension `main.js` file

## iOS install instructions

1. Open this repo on your iOS device, toggle desktop mode in your browser and download the repo
2. In the iOS Files app, find the downloaded repo, long press, and rename. Append .zip to the end of the file
3. Tap on the renamed zip folder to extract
4. Open SoundByte on your iOS device, tap on the "Me" tab
5. Click "Load From Device" and navigate to the music provider that you want to install (make sure you click on the "extension" subfolder - the one that contains the manifest.yml file)
